I am a Research Associate Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.utdallas.edu/) at [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/). I am a part of the Statistical Artificial Intelligence and Relational Learning Group ([Starling Lab](https://starling.utdallas.edu/))at UT Dallas.

My research interests include human-in-the-loop learning, knowledge-based and advice-taking learning algorithms, scalable and efficient learning algorithms, domain adaptation and non-convex optimization; with applications in large-scale medical informatics, social networking, text analytics, behavior mining and educational data mining.
