We investigate the viability of statistical relational machine learning algorithms for the task of identifying malignancy of renal
masses using radiomics-based imaging features. Features characterizing the texture, signal intensity, and other relevant metrics of
the renal mass were extracted from multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography images. The recently developed
formalism of relational functional gradient boosting (RFGB) was used to learn human-interpretable models for classification.
Experimental results demonstrate that RFGB outperforms many standard machine learning approaches as well as the current
diagnostic gold standard of visual qualification by radiologists.
