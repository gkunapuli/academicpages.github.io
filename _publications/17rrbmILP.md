We consider the problem of learning Boltzmann machine classifiers from relational data. Our goal is to extend the deep belief framework of RBMs to statistical relational models. This allows one to exploit the feature hierarchies and the non-linearity inherent in RBMs over the rich representations used in statistical relational learning (SRL). Specifically, we use lifted random walks to generate features for predicates that are then used to construct the observed features in the RBM in a manner similar to Markov Logic Networks. We show empirically that this method of constructing an RBM is comparable or better than the state-of-the-art probabilistic relational learning algorithms on six relational domains.
