Counting the number of true instances of a clause is arguably a major bottleneck in relational 
probabilistic inference and learning. We approximate counts in two steps: (1) transform the fully
grounded relational model to a large hypergraph, and partially-instantiated clauses to hypergraph motifs; 
(2) since the expected counts of the motifs are provably the clause counts, approximate them using 
summary statistics (in/out-degrees, edge counts, etc). Our experimental results demonstrate the 
efficiency of these approximations, which can be applied to many complex statistical relational models, 
and can be significantly faster than state-of-the-art, both for inference and learning, 
without sacrificing effectiveness.
