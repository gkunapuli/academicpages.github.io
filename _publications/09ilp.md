This paper introduces a new type of application for ILP called Bootstrapped Learning (BL). BL brings several challenges to ILP, including the need to automate the “ILP Set-Up” problem; small numbers of examples, in some cases no negative examples; and the need to bootstrap or to automatically base learning in part on the results of earlier learning sessions. The paper introduces BL, discusses the general challenges it raises for ILP, and presents initial results in ILP for BL.
