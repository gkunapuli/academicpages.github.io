We develop a pipeline to mine complex drug interactions by combining different similarities and interaction
types (molecular, structural, phenotypic, genomic etc). Our goal is to learn an optimal kernel from these
heterogeneous similarities in a supervised manner. We formulate an extensible framework that can easily
integrate new interaction types into a rich model. The core of our pipeline features a novel kernel-learning
approach that tunes the weights of the heterogeneous similarities, and fuses them into a Similarity-based
Kernel for Identifying Drug-Drug interactions and Discovery, or SKID^3. Experimental evaluation on the
DrugBank database shows that SKID^3 effectively combines similarities generated from chemical reaction
pathways (which generally improve precision) and molecular and structural fingerprints (which generally
improve recall) into a single kernel that gets the best of both worlds, and consequently demonstrates the best performance.
