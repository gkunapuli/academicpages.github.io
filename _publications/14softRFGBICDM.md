We consider the problem of learning probabilistic models from relational
data. One of the key issues with relational data is class imbalance where the
number of negative examples far outnumbers the number of positive examples.
The common approach for dealing with this problem is the use of sub-sampling
of negative examples. We, on the other hand, consider a soft margin approach
that explicitly trades off between the false positives and false negatives.
We apply this approach to the recently successful formalism of relational
functional gradient boosting. Specifically, we modify the objective function
of the learning problem to explicitly include the trade-off between false
positives and negatives. We show empirically that this approach is more
successful in handling the class imbalance problem than the original
framework that weighed all the examples equally.
