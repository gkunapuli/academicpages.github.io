  abstract="We develop a pipeline to mine complex drug interactions by combining
            different similarities and interaction types (molecular, structural,
            phenotypic, genomic etc). Our framework models each different type of
            interaction as a similarity, and Our goal is to learn an optimal kernel
            from these heterogeneous similarities in a supervised manner. We formulate
            an extensible framework that can easily integrate new interaction types
            into a rich model. The core of our pipeline features a novel
            kernel-learning approach that tunes the weights of the heterogeneous
            similarities, and fuses them into a Similarity-based Kernel for Identifying
            Drug-Drug interactions and Discovery, or SKID^3. Experimental evaluation on
            the DrugBank database shows that SKID^3 effectively combines similarities
            generated from chemical reaction pathways (which generally improve
            precision) and molecular and structural fingerprints (which generally
            improve recall) into a single kernel that gets the best of both worlds, and
            consequently demonstrates the best performance."
