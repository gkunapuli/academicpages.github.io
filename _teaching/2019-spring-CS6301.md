Course Description
-----
The main aim of the course is to provide Engineers and Scientists with a **hands-on understanding** of a broad variety of **machine-learning algorithms**. The course introduces several key as well as emerging/state-of-the-art machine learning alogrithms with a view toward practical usage and applications. The course aims to explore applications of machine learning in engineering, bioinformatics, economics, computer vision and many others as well as good machine learning practices in data pre-processing, modeling and evaluation.

Python Resources
----
The programming assignments will require coding in **Python** and will primarily use [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to explore various machine-learning algorithms. The following books may be useful as a **quick introduction to Python**:
* [_A Whirlwind Tour of Python_](https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf) (and its companion [repository of Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython)) by Jake VanderPlas is "...a fast-paced introduction to essential components of the Python language for researchers and developers who are already familiar with programming in another language" [author];
* [_Python Data Science Handbook_](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas (and its companion [repository of Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)) "introduces the core libraries essential for working with data in Python: particularly IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and related packages" [author].

The following books are also useful references if you want to learn Python from scratch:
* [_Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html) by Allen B. Downey;
* [_Automate the Boring Stuff with Python_](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.



Textbooks and Course Materials
----
There is **no required textbook** for this class. However, the following books are useful references for various topics we will cover in this course:
* _Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning_ by Christopher M. Bishop; this is a standard textbook and reference for introductory machine learning;
* _Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective_ by Kevin Murphy; another excellent book and reference, especially for probabilistic graphical models.

The following books are **available online, free for personal use**. Supplemental reading material will be
assigned from these sources as often as possible.
* _The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction_ by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman (available [online](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/))
* _Deep Learning_ by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville (available
[online](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)) is an excellent introductory textbook for a wide-variety of
deep learning methods and applications.

For **even more online resources**, see [_Awesome Machine Learning_](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning), Joseph Misiti's curated list of Machine Learning [books](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning/blob/master/books.md), frameworks, libraries and software.

The topic schedule is subject to change at the instructor's discretion. Please check this page regularly for lecture slides, additional references and reading materials.

**Tentative list** of topics that will be covered: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neighbor Methods, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Ensemble Methods (bagging, boosting, random forests, gradient boosting), Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Collaborative Filtering; good machine learning practices: pre-processing, model selection and evaluation, scalability and visualization. 

These topics will be **explored through applications** from computer vision, robotics, medicine and bioinformatics, economics, business, recommendation systems and others. If you have other applications in mind, the course project is an excellent avenue to explore the use of machine learning in that area.

Course Policies
=====

Attendance Policy
----
Classroom attendance for all lectures is mandatory. Prolonged absence from the lectures may lead to substantial grade penalties:
* two consecutive absences, no penalty;
* 3 consecutive absences: 1 letter grade drop;
* 4 consecutive absences, F grade.

Absence due to emergency or extenuating circumstances can be excused, but [proof may be required](http://cs.utdallas.edu/education/undergraduate/attendance-policy/).

Homework Policy
----
Homework assignments are **due at the start of class on the due date** without exceptions, unless permission was obtained from the instructor **in advance**. Homework and assignment deadlines will  not be extended except under extreme university-wide circumstances such as weather emergencies.

All homeworks, programming projects, take-home exams (if any) **are to be written up and completed individually**. You **may discuss, collaborate, brainstorm and strategize** ideas, concepts and problems with other students. However, all written solutions and coded programs **must be your own**. Copying another student's work or allowing other students to copy your work is academically dishonest.

Academic Integrity
----
All students are responsible for adhering to UT Dallas Community Standards and Conduct, particularly regarding [Academic Integrity](https://www.utdallas.edu/conduct/integrity/) and [Academic Dishonesty](https://www.utdallas.edu/conduct/dishonesty/).  Any academic dishonesty, including, but not restricted to [plagiarism](https://www.utdallas.edu/conduct/dishonesty/#plagiarism) (including from internet sources), [collusion](https://www.utdallas.edu/conduct/dishonesty/#collusion), [cheating](https://www.utdallas.edu/conduct/dishonesty/#cheating), [fabrication](https://www.utdallas.edu/conduct/dishonesty/#fabrication), will result in a zero score on the assignment/project/exam and possible disciplinary action.

Students with Disabilities
----
UT Dallas is committed to equal access in all endeavors for students with disabilities. The [Office of Student Accessability (OSA)](https://www.utdallas.edu/studentaccess/) provides academic accommodations for eligible students with a documented disability. Accommodations for each student are determined by OSA on an individual basis, with input from qualified professionals. Accommodations are intended to level the playing field for students with disabilities, while maintaining the academic integrity and standards set by the University. If you think you qualify for an academic accommodation, please visit OSA to determine eligibility. 

If you have already received academic accommodation, please contact me by e-mail to schedule an appointment **before classes start**, if possible.
